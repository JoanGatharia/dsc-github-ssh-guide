    "In this document you will set up a [Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) token to access GitHub securely over an unsecured network. When you create a SSH token pair you are using your computer to generate private and public SSH keys. The private key is added to the SSH agent on your local machine, and the public key is added to your GitHub account. When you clone repositories from GitHub using SSH, GitHub compares the public key to your private key to authenticate you as the correct user with the correct permissions. To get started using you will need a GitHub account, to create one [click here](https://github.com/signup)"
